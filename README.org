* Learn PyTorch
My personal experiments for learning PyTorch.

The most impressive demo is in ~SAC.ipynb~.
** Quickstart
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
2. ~pip install -r requirements.txt~
3. Start ~jupyter notebook~ and run ~SAC.ipynb~.
** Supported Python versions
As of Jan 2023, Python 3.10 is supported. PyTorch does not support newer versions of Python.

The box2d environments require Python development files.
