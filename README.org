* Learn PyTorch
My personal experiments for learning PyTorch.
** Quickstart
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
2. ~pip install -r requirements.txt~
3. Run ~python src/quickstart.py~
** Supported Python versions
As of Jan 2023, Python 3.10 is supported. PyTorch does not support newer versions of Python.

The box2d environments require Python development files.
