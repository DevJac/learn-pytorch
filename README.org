#+STARTUP: indent overview
* Learn PyTorch
My personal experiments for learning PyTorch.
** Supporting Technology
*** Poetry
See: https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/

The following commands may be useful:
#+begin_src
dnf install poetry
poetry help
poetry config --list
poetry run ipython
poetry shell
#+end_src
*** PyTorch
Poetry will install PyTorch.
**** PyTorch Poetry Fix
Poetry doesn't allow you to specify a custom repo for certain dependencies.

You may need to use pip to install PyTorch from a custom repo:

#+begin_src
pip3 install -U torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
#+end_src

This can be done by running ~fix-cu113.sh~.

See https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for up-to-date instruction on how to install PyTorch.
**** Tutorials

** Quickstart
1. Install poetry
2. Run ~poetry install~
3. Perform the [[PyTorch Poetry Fix]] if needed
